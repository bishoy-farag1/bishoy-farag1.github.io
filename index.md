### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 is one of my favorite labs as it introduced writing functions. Instead of writing too many nested if statements, functions made the program much easier to write and understand it if it was not your own program. Functions could make programming a lot easier if you make them questions it would help so much for anybody to understand what is written.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a very interesting lab as well because it showed me another level of interacting with the programs, now I donâ€™t just work with one file, but I can work with multiple files at once for the same program. Being able to write and read from files without having to open them is interesting for me.

* lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs because it introduced the ability to work with a header file and a CC file, also the ability to create images and how simple it is. Working with header files and CC files made the programs so much easier to understand without looking at the whole code.
